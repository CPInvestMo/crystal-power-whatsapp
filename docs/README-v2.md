# Crystal Intelligence - Supply-Demand Matching System

## üéØ CORE FUNCTIONALITY: MATCHES SUPPLY WITH DEMAND

**IMPORTANT:** This system does **NOT** send automated responses to WhatsApp messages. Instead, it intelligently matches property inventory (supply) with customer requirements (demand) and provides recommendations for human agents.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Supply-Demand Matching Flow:
1. **Lead Capture**: WhatsApp messages are received and analyzed for customer requirements
2. **Demand Processing**: AI extracts customer needs (budget, location, property type, etc.)
3. **Supply Matching**: Advanced algorithms match requirements with available properties
4. **Recommendation Generation**: System provides actionable recommendations for human agents
5. **Human Agent Action**: Agents contact customers based on intelligent matching results
